# IsoMasks

This is a repository for all the isoflurane masks designed in the lab over the years.

The inline aspiration masks have one chamber where the gas is carried in contact with the animal snout from one pipe, and the gas is sucked from the same chamber. This implies that the tuning of the aspiration volume/min affects the amount of anesthesia the animal recieves, which in turn makes the tuning of the level of anesthesia more complicated / intricated, and the isoflurane aspiration for the human user to not breathe is an after-thought. (isoflurane is hepatotoxic over the long term)

The concentric aspiration design has two chambers for the gas, one in the center, to wich gas input pipe is connected, and put next to the animal's snout. A second chamber that surroundds the first one is connected to the aspiration pipe, wich means that whatever the level of aspiration (in volume/min) the mice still gets to breethe the incoming gas first and when this gas exits the chamber it get a chance to be reaspired by the ouyter chamber. Resulting in easier aspiration and anesthesia tuning, and hopefully better liver protection for the user.
